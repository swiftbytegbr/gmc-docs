# GMC Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for Game Manager Cloud (GMC).

This site covers everything you need to build against GMC using:

- Java (default examples)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js)
- Python
- Direct REST API

Use the navigation to explore features (Nodes, Servers, Automations, Teams, Images, Settings, Info), clients, and guides.

## What is GMC?
GMC provides APIs and SDKs to manage game infrastructure: nodes, game servers, teams, and automations. Clients abstract the REST API and handle authentication, error mapping, and response parsing.

## At a Glance
- Manage nodes, servers, and teams programmatically
- Trigger and track automations and automation runs
- Upload images/assets and manage setting profiles
- Use application-level credentials (team-scoped)
- Async support in Java and JavaScript clients

## Quick Links
- Getting Started: `nav/getting-started.md`
- Authentication: `nav/authentication.md`
- Java Client (default): `nav/clients/java.md`
- REST API conventions: `nav/rest.md`
